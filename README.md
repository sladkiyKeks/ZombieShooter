**About the game**

**ZombieShooter** is a short wave-based survival FPS made in Unreal Engine 5. You're stationed at a desert checkpoint, under attack by endless waves of zombies. Your goal: survive for 3 minutes and make it out alive.

This prototype was created to showcase gameplay scripting, UI design, wave spawning, and basic shooter mechanics as part of my personal learning and portfolio.
